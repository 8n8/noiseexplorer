			<h2>Message Pattern Analysis</h2>
			<p>Message <span class="mono">B</span> is the second message in the <span class="mono">IX1</span> Noise Handshake Pattern. It is sent from the responder to the initiator.</p>
<h3>Sending Message <span class="mono">B</span></h3>
<p>In the applied pi calculus, the initiator's process prepares Message <span class="mono">B</span> using the following function:</p>
<p class="proverif">
letfun writeMessage_b(me:principal, them:principal, hs:handshakestate, payload:bitstring, sid:sessionid) =
	let (ss:symmetricstate, s:keypair, e:keypair, rs:key, re:key, psk:key, initiator:bool) = handshakestateunpack(hs) in
	let (ne:bitstring, ciphertext1:bitstring, ciphertext2:bitstring) = (empty, empty, empty) in
	let e = generate_keypair(key_e(me, them, sid)) in
	let ne = key2bit(getpublickey(e)) in
	let ss = mixHash(ss, ne) in
	(* No PSK, so skipping mixKey *)
	let ss = mixKey(ss, dh(e, re)) in
	let ss = mixKey(ss, dh(e, rs)) in
	let s = generate_keypair(key_s(me)) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, ciphertext1:bitstring) = encryptAndHash(ss, key2bit(getpublickey(s))) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, ciphertext2:bitstring) = encryptAndHash(ss, payload) in
	let hs = handshakestatepack(ss, s, e, rs, re, psk, initiator) in
	let message_buffer = concat3(ne, ciphertext1, ciphertext2) in
	(hs, message_buffer).
</p>
<h4>How each token is processed by the responder:</h4>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">e</span>: Signals that the responder is sending a a fresh ephemeral key share as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">writeMessage_b</span>:</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">mixHash</span>, which hashes the new key into the session hash.</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">ee</span>: Signals that the responder is calculating a a Diffie-Hellman shared secret derived from the initiator's ephemeral key and the responder's ephemeral key as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">writeMessage_b</span>:</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">mixKey</span>, which calls the HKDF function using, as input, the existing <span class="mono">SymmetricState</span> key, and <span class="mono">dh(e, re)</span>, the Diffie-Hellman share calculated from the initiator's ephemeral key and the responder's ephemeral key.</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">se</span>: Signals that the responder is calculating a a Diffie-Hellman shared secret derived from the initiator's static key and the responder's ephemeral key as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">writeMessage_b</span>:</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">mixKey</span>, which calls the HKDF function using, as input, the existing <span class="mono">SymmetricState</span> key, and <span class="mono">dh(s, re)</span>, the Diffie-Hellman share calculated from the initiator's static key and the responder's ephemeral key.</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">s</span>: Signals that the responder is sending a a static key share as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">writeMessage_b</span>:</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">encryptAndHash</span> is called on the static public key. If any prior Diffie-Hellman shared secret was established between the sender and the recipient, this allows the responder to communicate their long-term identity with some degree of confidentiality.</li>
</ul></ul>
<p>Message <span class="code">B</span>'s payload, which is modeled as the output of the function <span class="mono">msg_a(initiatorIdentity, responderIdentity, sessionId)</span>, is encrypted as <span class="mono">ciphertext2</span>. This invokes the following operations:</p><ul>
<li><span class="mono">encryptAndHash</span>, which performs an authenticated encryption with added data (AEAD) on the payload, with the session hash as the added data (<span class="mono">encryptWithAd</span>) and <span class="mono">mixHash</span>, which hashes the encrypted payload into the next session hash.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Receiving Message <span class="mono">B</span></h3>
<p>In the applied pi calculus, the initiator's process prepares Message <span class="mono">B</span> using the following function:</p>
<p class="proverif">
letfun readMessage_b(me:principal, them:principal, hs:handshakestate, message:bitstring, sid:sessionid) =
	let (ss:symmetricstate, s:keypair, e:keypair, rs:key, re:key, psk:key, initiator:bool) = handshakestateunpack(hs) in
	let (ne:bitstring, ciphertext1:bitstring, ciphertext2:bitstring) = deconcat3(message) in
	let valid1 = true in
	let re = bit2key(ne) in
	let ss = mixHash(ss, key2bit(re)) in
	(* No PSK, so skipping mixKey *)
	let ss = mixKey(ss, dh(e, re)) in
	let ss = mixKey(ss, dh(s, re)) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, plaintext1:bitstring, valid1:bool) = decryptAndHash(ss, ciphertext1) in
	let rs = bit2key(plaintext1) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, plaintext2:bitstring, valid2:bool) = decryptAndHash(ss, ciphertext2) in
	if ((valid1 && valid2) && (rs = getpublickey(generate_keypair(key_s(them))))) then (
		let hs = handshakestatepack(ss, s, e, rs, re, psk, initiator) in
		(hs, plaintext2, true)
	).
