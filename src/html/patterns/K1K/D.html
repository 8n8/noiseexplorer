			<h2>Message Pattern Analysis</h2>
			<p>Message <span class="mono">D</span> is the fourth message in the <span class="mono">K1K</span> Noise Handshake Pattern. It is sent from the responder to the initiator. In this detailed analysis, we attempt to give you some insight into the protocol logic underlying this message. The insight given here does not fully extend down to fully illustrate the exact state transformations conducted by the formal model, but it does describe them at least informally in order to help illustrate how Message <span class="mono">D</span> affects the protocol.</p>
<h3>Sending Message <span class="mono">D</span></h3>
<p>In the applied pi calculus, the initiator's process prepares Message <span class="mono">D</span> using the following function:</p>
<p class="proverif">
letfun writeMessage_d(me:principal, them:principal, hs:handshakestate, payload:bitstring, sid:sessionid) =
	let (ss:symmetricstate, s:keypair, e:keypair, rs:key, re:key, psk:key, initiator:bool) = handshakestateunpack(hs) in
	let (ne:bitstring, ciphertext1:bitstring, ciphertext2:bitstring) = (empty, empty, empty) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, ciphertext2:bitstring) = encryptAndHash(ss, payload) in
	let hs = handshakestatepack(ss, s, e, rs, re, psk, initiator) in
	let message_buffer = concat3(ne, ciphertext1, ciphertext2) in
	(hs, message_buffer).
</p>
Since Message <span class="mono">D</span> contains no tokens, it is considered purely an "AppData" type message meant to transfer encrypted payloads.
<p>If a static public key was communicated as part of this message, it would have been encrypted as <span class="mono">ciphertext1</span>. However, since the initiator does not communicate a static public key here, that value is left empty.</p>
<p>Message <span class="code">D</span>'s payload, which is modeled as the output of the function <span class="mono">msg_a(initiatorIdentity, responderIdentity, sessionId)</span>, is encrypted as <span class="mono">ciphertext2</span>. This invokes the following operations:</p><ul>
<li><span class="mono">encryptAndHash</span>, which performs an authenticated encryption with added data (AEAD) on the payload, with the session hash as the added data (<span class="mono">encryptWithAd</span>) and <span class="mono">mixHash</span>, which hashes the encrypted payload into the next session hash.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Receiving Message <span class="mono">D</span></h3>
<p>In the applied pi calculus, the initiator's process prepares Message <span class="mono">D</span> using the following function:</p>
<p class="proverif">
letfun readMessage_d(me:principal, them:principal, hs:handshakestate, message:bitstring, sid:sessionid) =
	let (ss:symmetricstate, s:keypair, e:keypair, rs:key, re:key, psk:key, initiator:bool) = handshakestateunpack(hs) in
	let (ne:bitstring, ciphertext1:bitstring, ciphertext2:bitstring) = deconcat3(message) in
	let valid1 = true in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, plaintext2:bitstring, valid2:bool) = decryptAndHash(ss, ciphertext2) in
	if ((valid1 && valid2)) then (
		let hs = handshakestatepack(ss, s, e, rs, re, psk, initiator) in
		(hs, plaintext2, true)
	).
</p>
Since Message <span class="mono">D</span> contains no tokens, it is considered purely an "AppData" type message meant to transfer encrypted payloads.
<p>If a static public key was communicated as part of this message, it would have been encrypted as <span class="mono">ciphertext1</span>. However, since the initiator does not communicate a static public key here, that value is left empty.</p>
<p>Message <span class="code">D</span>'s payload, which is modeled as the output of the function <span class="mono">msg_a(initiatorIdentity, responderIdentity, sessionId)</span>, is encrypted as <span class="mono">ciphertext2</span>. This invokes the following operations:</p><ul>
<li><span class="mono">decryptAndHash</span>, which performs an authenticated decryption with added data (AEAD) on the payload, with the session hash as the added data (<span class="mono">decryptWithAd</span>) and <span class="mono">mixHash</span>, which hashes the encrypted payload into the next session hash.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Queries and Results</h3>
Message <span class="mono">D</span> is tested against four authenticity queries and five confidentiality queries.
<h4>Authenticity Grade 1: <span class="passed">Passed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />event(RecvMsg(alice,bob,stagepack_d(sid_a),m)) ==> event(SendMsg(bob,c,stagepack_d(sid_b),m)) || event(LeakS(phase0,bob)) || event(LeakS(phase0,alice))</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>sender authentication</em> and <em>message integrity</em>. If Alice receives a valid message from Bob, then Bob must have sent that message to <em>someone</em>, or Bob had their static key compromised before the session began, or Alice had their static key compromised before the session began.</p>
<h4>Authenticity Grade 2: <span class="passed">Passed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />event(RecvMsg(alice,bob,stagepack_d(sid_a),m)) ==> event(SendMsg(bob,c,stagepack_d(sid_b),m)) || event(LeakS(phase0,bob))</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>sender authentication</em> and is <em>Key Compromise Impersonation</em> resistance. If Alice receives a valid message from Bob, then Bob must have sent that message to <em>someone</em>, or Bob had their static key compromised before the session began.</p>
<h4>Authenticity Grade 3: <span class="passed">Passed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />event(RecvMsg(alice,bob,stagepack_d(sid_a),m)) ==> event(SendMsg(bob,alice,stagepack_d(sid_b),m)) || event(LeakS(phase0,bob)) || event(LeakS(phase0,alice))</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>sender and receiver authentication</em> and <em>message integrity</em>. If Alice receives a valid message from Bob, then Bob must have sent that message to <em>Alice specifically</em>, or Bob had their static key compromised before the session began, or Alice had their static key compromised before the session began.</p>
<h4>Authenticity Grade 4: <span class="passed">Passed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />event(RecvMsg(alice,bob,stagepack_d(sid_a),m)) ==> event(SendMsg(bob,alice,stagepack_d(sid_b),m)) || event(LeakS(phase0,bob))</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>sender and receiver authentication</em> and is <em>Key Compromise Impersonation</em> resistance. If Alice receives a valid message from Bob, then Bob must have sent that message to <em>Alice specifically</em>, or Bob had their static key compromised before the session began.</p>
<h4>Confidentiality Grade 1: <span class="passed">Passed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />attacker_p1(msg_d(bob,alice,sid_b)) ==> event(LeakS(phase0,alice)) || event(LeakS(phase1,alice))</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>message secrecy</em> by checking if a passive attacker is able to retrieve the payload plaintext only by compromising Alice's static key either before or after the protocol session.</p>
<h4>Confidentiality Grade 2: <span class="passed">Passed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />attacker_p1(msg_d(bob,alice,sid_b)) ==> event(LeakS(phase0,alice)) || event(LeakS(phase1,alice))</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>message secrecy</em> by checking if an active attacker is able to retrieve the payload plaintext only by compromising Alice's static key either before or after the protocol session.</p>
<h4>Confidentiality Grade 3: <span class="passed">Passed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />attacker_p1(msg_d(bob,alice,sid_b)) ==> event(LeakS(phase0,alice)) || (event(LeakS(phase1,alice)) && event(LeakS(p,bob)))</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>forward secrecy</em> by checking if a passive attacker is able to retrieve the payload plaintext only by compromising Alice's static key before the protocol session, or after the protocol session along with Bob's static public key (at any time.)</p>
<h4>Confidentiality Grade 4: <span class="passed">Passed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />attacker_p1(msg_d(bob,alice,sid_b)) ==> event(LeakS(phase0,alice)) || (event(LeakS(phase1,alice)) && event(LeakS(p,bob)))</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>weak forward secrecy</em> by checking if an active attacker is able to retrieve the payload plaintext only by compromising Alice's static key before the protocol session, or after the protocol session along with Bob's static public key (at any time.)</p>
<h4>Confidentiality Grade 5: <span class="passed">Passed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />attacker_p1(msg_d(bob,alice,sid_b)) ==> event(LeakS(phase0,alice))</p>
<p>In this query, we test for <em>weak forward secrecy</em> by checking if an active attacker is able to retrieve the payload plaintext only by compromising Alice's static key before the protocol session.</p>
